        <h4>Web - English version</h4>

        <p>
            How can you know more about me than I do? How do you know I'm a man? How do you KNOWLEDGE?
            Irrelevant. If you don't know, why do you assume? It's gotten to the point where gender is defined by the
            vision of the doctor who saw your genitals, the scientists who study chromosomes. That's irrelevant, gender
            is you, sex? Not relevant, gender and sex - water and wine? Identity - bureaucracy that can be burned, discs
            that can stop working. It's you, you are your person. Sex? Gender? You didn't choose?

            What a disgrace, good thing we're in a world where if you stay, you suffer with your shadow, if you change
            you have a new nickname that haunts you and a society full of people who want to boss you around. The same
            people who argue if you're a human, if you have the same rights as the "rest". Deep down, we're all human,
            black or white, fat or skinny, boy or girl, disabled or autistic, nerd or athlete -
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"></p>
        <p>
            We're human and we fall into the same hole where we started. Cartoons no longer teach what they should. Humans need to be simple.
