        <h1>Free, in my opinion (08.2025)</h1>
        <h4>Web - English version</h4>

        <p>
            I have no religion, I don't want active burdens from the past, I have no mental illnesses, the
            responsibilities are so generalized in my head that they've become routine... I've never felt lighter,
            freer, more sentimental. I'm a person of few promises, promises for me are pacts with the soul, committing
            to do something even if it lasts the rest of your life, until your death. Promising something, for me, is
            like taking a little piece of your soul, of your person and trusting yourself and the subject to complete
            that task and put that little bit of your soul back in its place.

            I don't make promises to other people because they're unpredictable, they forget, they die, they go places,
            they develop unnecessarily complex lives... I am the person I trust the most for a thing like that, I tear a
            piece of myself to fulfill the promise, I would tear off a limb for a message to myself, I am in control of
            myself, if I'm not, no one else can be. I'm going to be a crazy person walking around. I hoped to change one
            day, leaving everything behind, living as a new person, new habits, new people, it was inevitable that my
            pasts would haunt me.
