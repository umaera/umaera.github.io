        <p>I found myself once again in a hotel, lying on a bed, at the top of the city that sparkled at night, I only heard very
        delicate sounds of cars on a highway echoing through the large space of the room, I turned off the lights — I didn't need
        them, I only had a well-kept bathroom right there, a bed right on the other side of the wall (soft), a balcony on
        the next wall to the right side of the bed, that balcony covered with unmarked tiles and glass panels as support, a little smoke would fit well there, I'm not a smoker.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"></p>
        <p>The television blinked and showed standby, the neighbors were watching a movie in the other room, muffled, but
        I could tell it was action from the loud and detailed noise of walls being torn down with screams.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"></p>
        <p>What was I doing there? I was escaping, escaping from something that only I knew, a feeling of coming home and
        having no one there for me, only for each one. I lit candles on cakes with strawberry frosting occasionally
        just for me, I bought jewelry just for me, I watched movies just for me, I celebrated and danced alone — just for me.
        I was my own person, I couldn't stand relationships, I couldn't stand people who only knew my
        old-self and judged my new-self as if I had replaced one jewel with another identical and fake one, those looks
        didn't fit me well.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"></p>
        <p>I was my own girlfriend, this reminded me of the promises (the few) that I made to myself, I was the
        person I committed to the most, I gave myself the most affection, smiled and cried the most. A person of few promises keeping her
        word.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"></p>
        <p>I was 16 years old and thought about one thing: I want a relationship, I want to commit to someone, I want to love, hug and
        have someone there to support me, pamper me, cherish and respect me. Deep down, I was full of nothing, I had
        nothing to give to that person, I spent so much time inventing something, something that would bring me together with that someone, I even wrote
        a letter, I started making my own prayer (without religion), preparing myself mentally.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"></p>
        <p>But, deep down — It was just me and myself, I was the one who knew me, I was the one who supported me the most, I was the one who
        loved me the most and I continue to be — I always will be!
        So what I always said about "I'm not compatible with relationships" is true, I never dated for more than 1 year,
        I never put up with the same shoes in a relationship because I change too fast, I change too slow, no one is
        prepared for my pace, no one can share the same table as me or ride the same roller coasters
        as me.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"></p>
        <p>Deep down, just me and me. Now yes, it makes me want to smoke on that balcony I mentioned at the beginning, but to remain
        more years on this planet (not guaranteed), I avoided it. I limited myself to just going to the nearest
        convenience store, I shared smiles with the young worker, I returned to the hotel, I guided myself to my apartment by
        the sound of drama/action happening in my neighbors' room and I went in to drink my peach iced-tea.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"></p>
        <p>Looking at the city at night, one building at a time, breathing deeply and finally convincing myself to sleep, to spend
        another day, without hurry.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"></p>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; margin-top:50px;">— The End —</p>
